                    </h4>
                    <p>Stuttering is a speech disorder characterized by repetition of sounds, syllables, or words;
                        prolongation of sounds; and interruptions in speech known as blocks. An individual who stutters
                        exactly knows what he or she would like to say but has trouble producing a normal flow of
                        speech. These speech disruptions may be accompanied by struggle behaviors, such as rapid eye
                        blinks or tremors of the lips. Stuttering can make it difficult to communicate with other
                        people, which often affects a person’s quality of life and interpersonal relationships.
                        Stuttering can also negatively influence job performance and opportunities, and treatment can
                        come at a high financial cost..</p>
                    <h4>''Almost 80 million people worldwide stutter, about 1% of the world's population.''</h4>
